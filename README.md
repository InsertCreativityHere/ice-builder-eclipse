# Ice Builder for Eclipse

The Ice Builder for Eclipse provides a plug-in which automates the compilation
of [Slice](https://doc.zeroc.com/display/Ice/The+Slice+Language) files using the
[Slice-to-Java](https://doc.zeroc.com/display/Ice/slice2java+Command-Line+Options)
compiler and manages the resulting generated code.

An [Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice) installation with `slice2java`
version 3.4.2 or higher is required.

The Ice Builder for Eclipse plug-in provides the following features:
 - Automatically compiles all the Slice files in your project
 - Incrementally recompiles Slice files after modifications
 - Maintains dependencies between Slice files
 - Highlights Slice compilation errors in your source code
 - Manages code generated by `slice2java` and removes obsolete generated files
automatically

## Installing the Ice Builder Plug-in

The Ice Builder for Eclipse is distributed through the Eclipse Marketplace:

 1. From the `Help` menu, choose `Eclipse Marketplace`
 2. Search for `Ice Builder`
 3. Click `Install` to install the `Ice Builder` plug-in

## Upgrade Notes

### From Ice Builder 4.0

The Ice Builder 4.0 adds all the project's Slice directories to the list of 
include directories during compilation.

Newer versions of Ice Builder no longer add these directories to the list
of include directories. As a result, when upgrading from Ice Builder 4.0 to
the latest Ice Builder, you may need to add some of your project's Slice
directories to the Include Directories (see
[Configuring Project Settings](#configuring-project-settings) below).

### From a 3.x Plug-in

If you are upgrading from an Ice plug-in version 3.x, you should uninstall
the old plug-in before installing the Ice Builder. For such versions, after
installation it might be necessary to manually reconfigure the Ice Builder
settings as old settings are not automatically migrated.

## Usage

### Configuring the Plug-in

The plug-in preferences can be accessed by navigating to `Window -> Preferences`
and selecting `Ice Builder`.

![Preferences Dialog](/Screenshots/preferences.png)

You can use `Ice Home` to specify where `slice2java` and the Ice Slice
files are located. Ice Builder looks for `slice2java` in the `bin` subdirectory
of `Ice Home`, and for the Slice files in the following subdirectories of `Ice Home`:
 - `share/slice`
 - `share/ice/slice`
 - `share/Ice-<version>/slice`, where `<version>` is the output returned by
    `slice2java -v`
 - `slice`

The Ice Builder uses the following `Ice Home` directories by default:

| Platform | Default Ice Home                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | /usr                                                     |
| macOS    | /usr/local                                               |
| Windows  | Latest Ice installation recorded in the Windows registry |

`Build Automatically` allows you to choose whether Slice files should be rebuilt
automatically as they are updated; it is generally recommended to disable this
option for larger projects.

### Activating the Plug-in for a Project

The plug-in is enabled on a per project basis. To enable it, right click on the
project, choose `Ice Builder` and select `Add Ice Builder`.

![Activating the Plug-in](/Screenshots/activation.png)

Upon activation, the project immediately creates a `generated` directory to hold
the Java source files the Slice compiler generates from your Slice files.

To de-activate the plug-in, navigate to the `Ice Builder` menu and select
`Remove Ice Builder`. Removing the Ice Builder plug-in will remove all the
generated code but will not affect your Slice files.

### Configuring Project Settings

To configure the project-specific settings, select `Properties` from the
`Project` menu or right-click on the name of your project and choose
`Properties`. Click on the `Ice Builder` menu to view the plug-in's settings
for the selected project.

The `Generated Code Directory` allows you to specify where all generated files
should be placed in the project. By default, the plug-in uses the `generated`
directory for this. To change the directory, you must first create the new
directory, and then click `Browse` to navigate to it. The new directory must be
empty, and the plug-in requires exclusive use of it: any files or changes made
to the directory will be lost during the next Slice compilation.

The `Include Directories` list allows you to specify Slice include directories
passed to `slice2java` through its `-I` option. These directories are searched
by `slice2java` in the order you specify them. The Ice Builder automatically adds
the Slice directory found within `Ice Home` to the end of this list.

You can pass additional options to the Slice compiler with the `Additional
Options` field. For a list of all supported options and their descriptions,
refer to the `slice2java` page in the
[Ice Manual](https://doc.zeroc.com/display/Ice/slice2java+Command-Line+Options).

### Compiling Slice Files

Slice files can be manually compiled through Eclipse or by using the `Compile`
Button under the `Ice Builder` project menu.

If automatic building is enabled, Slice files will be compiled if one of
the following is true:
 * Any Slice files in the project have been updated since the last compilation
through the plug-in (this includes removing Slice files from projects).
 * The options used to compile Slice files have changed.

During a full build, the Ice Builder plug-in automatically searches all
directories within your project's scope for Slice files, and compiles all of
them, in addition to removing any obsolete generated code.

For incremental builds, only the Slice files that have changed in the project,
and the Slice files in the project that directly or indirectly reference them,
are recompiled, and their corresponding generated code updated.

## Building the Plug-in from Source

In order to build the plug-in, you need an installation of Eclipse suitable
for plug-in development.

You also need to install the Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment if it is
not already installed. Go to `Help > Eclipse Marketplace` and search for
`Eclipse PDE`, then click `Install` to install the Eclipse PDE.

To import the project choose `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into
Workspace` and select the java directory in this repository as the root
directory.

To create the plug-in, use `File > Export > Plug-in Development > Deployable
plug-ins and fragments`.
